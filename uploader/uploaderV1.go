// Processing for any V1 ETX operations, remaining before the server upgrade.
//
// There were three problems with the V1 design.
// (1) It didn't allow for cached web pages referencing recently deleted or replaced media files.
//     The V2 design defers the removal of media files for a specified duration.
// (2) A media file upload was not actually committed on disk until after it had been processed,
//     so that a server restart could cause it to be lost after the user believed it had been uploaded
//     successfully. This was not a significant problem for image files, but videos can take minutes to
//     process.
// (3) Uploading media files faster than they could be processed could overload the memory of a small server.
//
// The improvements in turn required an upgrade to ETX, so that it could manage the recovery of
// a larger number of operations without overloading the memory of a small server.

// V1 requests the uploader to handle V1 extended transactions.
