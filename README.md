## Features

This is an assorted set of Go packages shared between a couple of Inchworks web applications.

- images : management of uploaded images.
- limiterhandler : rate limiting of HTTP requests to mitigate password guessing and other probes.
- multiforms : handling of HTTP forms with sub-forms.
- server : an HTTPS web server with an idiosyncratic configuration.
- users : user signup, log-in and management for a pre-approved set of application users.

For examples of use, see https://github.com/inchworks/picinch.

## Contributing

This is work in progress, and likely to change.
So I can only accept pull requests for minor fixes or improvements to existing facilities.
Please open issues to discuss new features.
